# Node---Express-Server-a-REST-operation

Having fun with Node & Express Server, and using an api end point tester-insomnia.
Similar to the project on GraphQL/with apollo server, only that this time we dont define typeDefs and resolvers coz its a REST operation.
The first functioon in the index.js "gets" the whole array of people object and displays in in the insomnia application.
The second function in the index.js "posts" a new people object to our array.
The Third function in the index.js "Deletes" a people object from the array.
